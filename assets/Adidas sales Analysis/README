Adidas Sales Performance Analysis 📊
Portfolio Overview

This project presents an interactive Adidas Sales Dashboard designed to provide executive-level visibility into sales performance, profitability, and regional trends. The analysis consolidates key metrics into a single view, enabling faster, data-driven decision-making across regions, states, and sales channels.

BUSINESS PROBLEM

Adidas needed a clear and centralized way to:

Monitor overall sales and profit performance

Identify high- and low-performing regions and states

Understand how sales channels (In-store, Online, Outlet) impact revenue

Track performance trends across time

Raw sales data alone made it difficult for stakeholders to quickly extract insights and act strategically.

OBJECTIVES

Analyze total sales, profit, and units sold

Compare regional and state-level performance

Evaluate sales methods and time-based trends

Highlight areas for growth and optimization

KEY KPI

Total Sales: 900M

Total Units Sold: 2M

Total Profit: 332M

Profit Margin Growth: +9.52%

Sales Growth: +9.47%

KEY INSIGHTS

The West region dominates sales with 270M, nearly double the lowest-performing region

Sales are highly concentrated in top states such as New York, California, and Florida

The Mid-West underperforms despite population size, indicating potential strategic gaps

Discount and channel performance vary significantly by region

Clear seasonality trends are visible across months and years

RECOMMENDATION
